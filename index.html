        <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>My name is Aaron Sumner, of Lawrence, Kansas, USA; by way of Seattle, Washington, and Jersey County, Illinois.</p>

<p>I'm a long-time web developer, at it since 1994 when I began creating some of the very first departmental and organizational websites as an undergraduate at the University of Kansas. Over the years I've worked my way through static HTML to Applescript (yes, Applescript) to Perl to PHP to Ruby. Since 2005 I've worked mostly with Ruby and Rails, with a dose of Javascript.</p>

<p>I'm an independent author with an introduction to the RSpec test framework to my credit. I also blog about Rails on occasion.</p>

<p>By day I manage web and educational technology research and development at the University of Kansas Center for Research on Learning. I've also worked past stints at the University of Washington, the University of Kansas Medical Center, and as a freelance software developer. To date most of my work has been done in the public and non-profit sectors; particularly in education. I hold a bachelor's degree in Journalism from the University of Kansas, and a master's degree in Instructional Design and Technology from Emporia State University.</p>

<p>On the side I enjoy photography, baseball, college basketball, music and bowling.</p>
